Prep 1 head napa cabbage (cored and shredded), 6 green onions (chopped), 2 carrots (grated), 1 daikon radish (grated), 5 garlic cloves (minced) and place in large bowl. Add 3 tbsp of salt and 3 tbsp of chilli flakes.

Massage cabbage mix for about 10 minutes and then set aside. Return to massage for another 10 minutes, until cabbage and other veggies are softened and a few tablespoons worth of water has been released. Divide the mix between two 1 litre mason jars.

Press kimchi mix down, helping get out any air bubbles and ideally have some of the liquid come to the top. eal jar loosely and place in a warm spot and let sit for 4-5 days. 

Once ready, seal the jar and store in your fridge. Will keep for 2-3 months sealed.
